## For loops

# Loops and data structures always start with 0
# This represents numbers in a range from and including 0 and 99
for x in range(100):
    print('x')

# By using the break and continue statement 
# you can "break" or "continue" the loop as you see fit
for x in range(100):
    print('x')
    if x == 50:
        break
    else:
        continue


## While loops
condition = True

while condition:
    print('This could be anything')
